# Classification of pairs Sequence feature/Categorical feature 

This small repository enables running training of a few simple models (Random Forest, Fully Connected, Bert + Fully Connected).
The data consisting of 2 features: a sequence one, and a categorical one, is private and not made available here.

## Description

I developed this code to try very simple solutions on medical data classification. It consists mainly of a few notebooks to run the different experiments.
The notebooks call modules that I developed: typically 2 simple pytorch datasets to load the features with a an oversampler (for unbalanced datasets), as well as pytorch models and preprocessing functions (one hot encoder etc).
Feel free to use it on data that has similar features, as only the preprocessing would change.
